# Redux Store

# Description

For our week 22 assignment we had to refactor the e-commerce platform for an online store so that it uses Redux.

Name: Redux Store

As the developer, I want the platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
so that my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem. When the user or other developers review the way the app determines changes, the way the app extracts data, and the way the app dispatches actions, they find that the app uses Redux instead of Context API.
